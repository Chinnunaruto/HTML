    <h2> hr </h2>
    <p>The &lt;hr&gt; element used to stand for "horizontal line" and that is still how it is typically displayed by browsers.However, in HTML5 the tag took on a semantic meaning,"semantic break".I will be using it often to break up example files when I wnt to display multiple tage in one file.<br></p><hr>
    
    <h2>address</h2>
    <p>The &lt;address&gt; element indicates that the text in the address specific to the page,perhaps contact information for the author.</p>

    <h2>blockquote</h2>
    <p>The &lt;blockquote&gt; element is used for quotations.It should include the cite attribute in order to show or link to the source of the quote.<br></p>

    <h2>details</h2>
    <p>The &lt;details&gt; element is used in conjunction with the &lt;summary&gt; tag.It is one of the tags that was created in response to the repeated use of scripting to open and close content.It is not not supported by all of the browsers yet though.</p>

    <details>The rest of the details content goes here.If only &lt;details&gt; is not supported,then the summary and the content wil always be visible.
