    <header><h1>The inline tags</h1></header>
    <p>Why do we bother with inline elements?There are certainly times we want to mark up content,but we don't wnt to insert the line breaks around them.The &lt;span&gt; tag was the first to give you the ability,but it was mostly used to style the code,and we don't want to do that.Some of the newer tags that still separate content and style are listed below.Remember,inline tags can flow next to each other and don't cause a line breakbefore and after the element.We have seen this with links and images.</p>

    <h2>Citing a source - cite</h2>
    <p>The &lt;cite&gt; makes it easier for people and bots to search the code for this specific information.</p>
    <p>A great reference for these and other elements is <cite>https://developer.mozilla.origin-US/docs/Web/HTML</cite></p>

    <h2>Defining yuor abbreviations - abbr</h2>
    <p>The &lt;abbr&gt; will display an abbreviation on the browser.But if a title attribute is specified in the tag,the title will appear when the mouse hovers over the abbreviation.Screen readers also provide the title information.</p>
    <p>The days of the week are often abbreviated:<abbr title="Sunday">Sun</abbr>,<abbr title="Monday">Mon</abbr>,<abbr title="Tuesday">Tue</abbr>,<abbr title="Wednesday">Wed</abbr>,<abbr title="Thursday">Thu</abbr>,<abbr title="Friday">Fri</abbr>,<abbr title="Saturday">Sat</abbr></p>

    <h2>Specifying the use of time-time</h2>
     <p>The &lt;time&gt; is again a completely semantic tag that can be used to search for specific information.</p>

     <p>The party starts at <time>9:00pm</time></p>

     <p>The party took place on <time datetime="2016-01-01">New Year's Eve.</time></p>
     
     <h2>Identifying the fragments of the code</h2>
     <p>The &lt;code&gt; elements tends to be displayed ina different font , but also has the semantic meaning to conve information to as many people as possible.</p>
     <p>I have been trying to learn how to write html but my <code>img</code> elements never seem to work.</p>

     <h2>Using subscripts and superscripts - sub and sup</h2>
     <p>The &lt;sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt; elements are used to create the super and subscripts,e.g.(x+y)<sup>3</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>O.In the past,people would often paste mathematical images into the page.But images didn't convey the same meaning to all users.</p>
